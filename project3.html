            <p class="mt-4" style="font-size:1.5vw;">Human activities each day require energy and nutrients that the
                body obtains from consuming meals. Knowing how to choose appropriate foods according to the body's needs
                helps it to grow fully, thrive, and maintain robust physical health. The creators therefore conceived
                the idea to develop a project for designing and developing a game to learn about proper nutritional
                choices. With the aim of imparting nutritional knowledge in the form of Game-based learning, the goal is
                for players to easily understand and enjoy the learning process.

            <p class="mt-4" style="font-size:1.5vw;">My Health Meal is a single-player life simulation game where
                players control a character from start to finish. Players navigate through various locations with
                different mini-games designed to educate them about making proper nutritional choices. They can assess
                the correctness of their daily food consumption.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-4" style="font-size:1.5vw;">Players must apply nutritional knowledge to progress through the
                game, with different skills embedded in each mini-game. These skills include basic nutritional
                decision-making abilities applicable in everyday life. Players can continuously play to practice and
                refine their skills in making informed nutritional choices.

            <p class="mt-5" style="font-size:1.5vw;">My Healthy Meal consists of 2 Mini games, Restaurant and Quiz,
                respectively. When the game starts, players will be able to choose which Mini game to play.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-5" style="font-size:1.5vw;">In the
                mini-game 'Restaurant,' players start with 5 hearts. They can choose from 10 food items in sequence,
                selecting up to 5 dishes maximum. Each time a food item is chosen, the hearts do not decrease. They can
                also skip or pass on up to 5 dishes. Each time a dish is skipped or passed, 1 heart is deducted. The
                game randomly presents a total of 15 food items, each categorized as sweet, oily, or salty. When a
                player selects a food item, the corresponding energy tube increases. Players see the summary of sweet,
                oily, and salty energy tubes at the end after selecting the 10th food item.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-5" style="font-size:1.5vw;">In the mini-game 'Quiz,' players must answer 10 true/false
                questions. Each correct answer earns 1 point, while each incorrect answer earns 0 points. At the end, a
                summary of the player's food consumption choices is displayed.

            <p class="mt-4" style="font-size:1.5vw;">The project to design and develop a game for making informed food
                choices based on nutritional principles stems from awareness of the importance of learning to make
                nutritionally balanced food choices. This aims to reduce mortality due to overweight and obesity. It
                advocates for changing perspectives and attitudes in accurately communicating about obesity to raise
                public awareness. However, there is a lack of training and dissemination of this content to the general
                youth due to educational personnel readiness and various other factors. This issue is close to home as
                daily food consumption habits have become routine. Therefore, there is a need to create tools that
                facilitate the transfer of skills and knowledge in an accessible and engaging format. Thus, designing
                and developing a learning game is chosen as the method for this project.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-4" style="font-size:1.5vw;">After summarizing the approach to carrying out this project, the
                project team began researching information about software or tools used in game development. After
                comparing various tools and conducting research, Unity was selected for game development. Unity was
                chosen because it is a beginner-friendly game development program that is easy to use and offers high
                flexibility.
            </p>
            <h1 class="p-1 font-weight-normal mt-5"><strong>Problems and Solutions</strong></h1>
            <p class="mt-4" style="font-size:1.5vw;">Due to the critical importance of My Health Meal game being able to
                effectively convey knowledge on making nutritionally balanced food choices in an easily understandable
                and enjoyable format, maintaining alignment and balance between storyline and gameplay mechanics has
                been a recurring challenge in the project's design phase. Overloading the game with nutritional content
                could potentially diminish its entertainment value, while too little information may not sufficiently
                educate players on proper food choices. Therefore, achieving a balance between nutritional education and
                engaging gameplay remains crucial. In addition to narrative design challenges, there have also been
                issues encountered in creating art assets and graphics, such as managing artwork borders and tools for
                seamless character animations to maintain natural movement perspectives.

            <li class="mt-4" style="font-size:1.5vw;">The current version of My Healthy Meal game doesn't offer many
                locations or mini-games to choose from, and each type of food may have more than one flavor. Therefore,
                there may be additions to allow each type of food to have more than one flavor.</li>
            <li class="mt-4" style="font-size:1.5vw;">Creating a database to store scores, such as which players have
                completed the Restaurant game without exceeding any energy tubes, for the highest number of rounds,
                etc., will help stimulate challenge among players.</li>
            <li class="mt-4" style="font-size:1.5vw;">Choose foods that balance the amount of sweetness, fat, and salt
                types to avoid players having the opportunity to choose foods with one type of sweetness, fat, or salt
                more than others.</li>
            <li class="mt-4" style="font-size:1.5vw;">The colors of the sweetness, fat, and salt indicators may not
                currently convey or align with the meaning of the sweet, fat, and salt levels. Therefore, they
                should be clearly specified in easily understandable terms, and should include numerical units or units
                of measurement for each indicator, so that players can clearly understand how much of each energy type
                they have selected in their food choices.</li>
            <li class="mt-4" style="font-size:1.5vw;">The questions should be revised to include both correct and
                incorrect food consumption options mixed together, so that players do not simply answer with just "Yes"
                or "No".
            </li>
            <li class="mt-4" style="font-size:1.5vw;">The game "My Healthy Meal" still lacks fun, which can be added.
                For example, adding exercise activities. In the summary page of the Restaurant game, in addition to
                informing players about which foods they have consumed excessively, suggestions can be added regarding
                which types of food should be consumed instead. It might also encourage players to engage in exercise
                activities to reduce the intake of sweet, fat, or salt.
            </li>
            <li class="mt-4" style="font-size:1.5vw;">Add character animations such as jumping or dying.
